# ‚öôÔ∏è Embers Adrift Modding Framework ‚Äì Private Injector Edition

Join our Discord to find out how to utilize our mods on Embers Adrift:  
https://discord.gg/DNcNvRyMtD

Welcome to the official addon repository for Embers Adrift, now powered by our custom-built injector framework for enhanced privacy, security, and ease of use.

## ‚ùå Why We Left MelonLoader:

- Logs mod names, patch info, and runtime behavior to both console and disk.
- Not stealthy ‚Äî easy to detect in monitored/logged environments.
- No longer viable for secure or private modding.

## üö´ Disclaimer

This mod framework is not officially endorsed or supported by Stormhaven Studios.

- Modding is at your own risk.
- Mods may cause game crashes or be broken by future updates.
- Use of mods may violate the game's Terms of Service.
- Neither Stormhaven Studios nor the mod developers are responsible for bans or data loss.
- You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with any agreements or policies.

## üìö Additional Notes

- All MelonLoader support has been fully removed.
- We've taken steps to protect users who continue using QoL improvements by transitioning to our private injector framework.
- Our goal is not malicious ‚Äî it‚Äôs to enhance the player experience for those who actively enjoy your game.
- Mods are still hosted on GitHub for transparency.
- The injector is distributed only through Discord for controlled access and added security.
- Full support and documentation are available in the community.

üõ°Ô∏è Thank you for choosing a safer and more private way to enhance your Embers Adrift experience.
