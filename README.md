# ‚öôÔ∏è Embers Adrift Modding Framework ‚Äì Private Injector Edition

Welcome to the official addon repository for **Embers Adrift**, now powered by our **custom-built injector framework** for enhanced privacy, security, and ease of use.

> **Discord**: [Join for access & support](https://discord.gg/DNcNvRyMtD)

---

### ‚ùå Why We Left MelonLoader:

- Logs mod names, patch info, and runtime behavior to both console and disk.
- Not stealthy ‚Äî easy to detect in monitored/logged environments.
- No longer viable for secure or private modding.

### üì¶ Installation Instructions

> **Step-by-step:**

1. **Join the Discord** and download the latest injector build from the `#releases` channel.
2. Extract the injector to its own folder.
3. Create a subfolder named `DLL` (all caps) in the same directory.
4. Drop your `.dll` mod files into the `DLL` folder.
5. **Run the injector as Administrator.**  
   It will detect the game, inject your mods, and exit cleanly.
